
Photon Emscripten SDK
------------------------------------------

Photon is the world's #1 independent networking engine and multiplayer platform â€” Fast, reliable, scalable.

Use the Photon Emscripten SDK to easily add multiplayer to your games.
Run them in the global Photon Cloud or host your own Photon Servers.
Match your players to a shared game session (called "room") and transfer messages synchronously, in real-time, between connected players across platforms.
All client SDKs can interact with each other, no matter if iOS, Android, web, console or standalone.
